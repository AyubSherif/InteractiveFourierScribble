# üé® Interactive Fourier Scribble

This educational tool is an **interactive Fourier series visualizer**, designed to help users intuitively understand how Fourier approximations work in representing arbitrary signals.

I built this tool for my mom's physics class (My mom is a **physics professor**).

## üîß How It Works

1. The user draws a signal using their mouse.
2. The signal is sampled and interpolated to a uniform grid.
3. A discrete Fourier transform is computed using `numpy.fft`.
4. Only the selected number of modes (harmonics) are kept.
5. The inverse transform reconstructs the signal from those modes.
6. The original and approximated signals are plotted together.

## üîç What It Illustrates

1. Fourier Decomposition of Functions:

    - It shows how any drawn signal (even non-standard ones) can be approximated by summing a finite number of sine and cosine terms‚Äîi.e., Fourier modes.

    - The "Fourier Modes" slider lets users control how many harmonics are used in the reconstruction, revealing how approximation quality improves with more terms.

2. Signal Reconstruction and Convergence:

    - It illustrates how low-order approximations capture only the basic shape or average of the signal.

    -  As the number of modes increases, finer details and sharper features emerge‚Äîdemonstrating convergence of Fourier series.
